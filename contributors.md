#For Programmers
Before any code can be submitted to the projects. You must sign an CLA. This is to protect both you and the CodeAndUnite Organization. Once you send us your PR we will send you your form to fill out quickly online.


###Code Expectations
When you submit a pull-request we expect your code to be throughly tested, and that it has a decent amount of styling. We are still setting up our testing method so please component test your code with  stubs and drivers. Please understand that all code will likely be refactored as we are in the early stages of development.
