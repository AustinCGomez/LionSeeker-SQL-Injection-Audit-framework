Please don't worry about your coding skill levels. We were all beginners once, and are more than glad to help out. Allow us 0-2 days to respond as the team is primarly college-students with busy sechedules. 

### Technical Writers:
Most programmers are not the best at writing. We would love some help in improving our grammar and documents. 

### Testers:
We cannot test everything with two sets of eyes. Additional testers will allow for us to see bugs and issues that we might skipped over. 

### Promoters:
There is a lot of tools in pen-testing. As a promoter, we could love your help to promote our tool on forum sites. We do not make any money but as a open-source tools it is always fulfilling to see people using it. 

### Research Team:
Want to make this a GUI version? Or bring it to Windows, Android, IOS, OSX?  Join the research team! This team is responsible for basically bringing there ideas of expanding the program into different environements. For example, if you want to make this tool for Windows and you show the skills to do it. We will appoint you as the Team Lead for that project and grant you a distro to make it. 

#### What you get in return for contributing:

Second, you can use your contribution for your future resume. You never know if a open-source project is gonna be huge. So, if Lionseeker takes off you will be known as a early developer/etc and it will look good on your resume. Third, satisfication of making somthing for people. Simply, there isno better feeling than knowing people enjoy your product. 

*Note: This is not a tool for hacking websites, merely it is designed to show you the vulnerabilities of many websites. You will have to use another tool to actually do automated SQL injection We will not be held accountable for misuse (as our license states). Always consent with the website owner before using a pen-testing tool of any kind.*
