Lion seeker; Open-Source Mass SQL Injection Checker. 
V0.0.0
*V0.0.1 in progress. Not ready for use by consumers* 
# Checkout our Projects and Issues tab! We have many begineer friendly PRs you can contribute today! 
## Capabilities:
The idea about LionSeeker is to be able to test multiple websites at once for SQL injection vulnerabilities. This will be done by feeding the program payloads. It will use these payloads to test the websites for the potential vulnerbilities. Upon a successful vulernability find, the program will either take a snapshot of the vulernability or describe it in a text file. 

## Development:
This application is being built in C++  As I am a student, my knowledge of programming are limited. However, we can speed up the process of completing this project by open source contributions. Please view the Projects tab to see some of the areas we are workin on. Then, you can talk to us on lionseeker.slack.com and get started on working on it. Please be aware that the code will undergo a great amount of refactoring as I get more familar witht he C++ programming environment and more knowledge about CS. 

## License:
If you use this application, please do not use it for harm. This tool is meant for cyber security assessments only. In addition, we are under the GPL license.
