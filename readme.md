# I intend to make this project soon, but due to my limit(but ever growing) knowledge of C++, and my time-constrants with university, I have to put this project on halt untilI I have more C++ skils. An alternative is to get some developers to help me build this project, that would be wonderful. 

Lion seeker; Open-Source Mass SQL Injection Checker
This program is not live yet. This is our initial launch to make it open source. Check the beta development branch for live(and potentially unstable) commits.

IRC: We use freenode. Check us out at #lionseeker

We would greatly appreciate any help we could get. The more help we have, the faster we can get this launched. The core team is also fairly new into programming, so we will gladly accept beginners, but you must be willing to learn, and use our proper code structure. 

LionSeeker is a mass SQL Injection Checker. Its goals is to test websites for basic SQL vulnerabilities. 

Note: This is not a tool for hacking websites, merely it is designed to show you the vulnerabilities of many websites. You will have to use another tool to actually do automated SQL injection. That is not in the philosophy of our product nor do we wish to implement such things.
