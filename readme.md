Lion seeker; Open-Source Mass SQL Injection Checker
This program is not live yet. This is our initial launch to make it open source. Check the beta development branch for live(and potentially unstable) commits.

LionSeeker is a mass SQL Injection Checker. Its goals is to test websites for basic SQL vulnerabilities. 

Note: This is not a tool for hacking websites, merely it is designed to show you the vulnerabilities of many websites. You will have to use another tool to actually do automated SQL injection. That is not in the philosophy of our product nor do we wish to implement such things.
