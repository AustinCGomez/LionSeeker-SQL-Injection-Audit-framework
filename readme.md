Lion seeker; Open-Source Mass SQL Injection Checker. 
V0.0.0
*V0.0.1 in progress. Not ready for use by consumers* 

## Capabilities:
The idea about LionSeeker is to be able to test multiple websites at once for SQL injection vulnerabilities. This will be done by feeding the program payloads. It will use these payloads to test the websites for the potential vulnerbilities. Upon a successful vulernability find, the program will either take a snapshot of the vulernability or describe it in a text file. 

## Development:
This application is being built in C++  As I am a student, my knowledge of programming are limited. However, we can speed up the process of completing this project by open source contributions. Please view the Projects tab to see some of the areas we are workin on. Then, you can talk to us on lionseeker.slack.com and get started on working on it. Please be aware that the code will undergo a great amount of refactoring as I get more familar witht he C++ programming environment and more knowledge about CS. 

## License:
If you use this application, please do not use it for harm. This tool is meant for cyber security assessments only. In addition, we are under the GPL license. 

## Contribute
We welcome programmers of all levels to come and help make our product great! Since we are moving fast, we highly encourage you to come talk to us on discord to not waste time on a bug that someone else is working on. In addition, we provide mentoring to find you a suitable bug if you are new to coding. https://discordapp.com/channels/284972356907040769 . 

All contributions might adhere to our Style Guide (Google C++ Style Guide) and should come with an associated header file of tests. We do not have unit tests set up yet so, our core developers will use that header file to test your code vigirously and add more tests to try and break it. After we perform our tests, we will give you a verdict and merge it if it meets quality. 

### We don't just need coders! 
We need
- Technical Writers
- Testers (Create target dummy websites with SQL injections to test our tool)
- Promoters (Promote our product on forums that deal with cyber security. Get feedback and create issues on suggestions by people)

Once again, please check our contributers.md file.
